# critic_flutter

This plugin allows Flutter apps to interact with the Inventiv Critic system for bug tracking and reporting. You will need to have a Critic account to properly utilize this. Please visit [the Critic website](https://critictracking.com/getting-started/) for more information.

## How to use

Step 1: Initialize the Critic library using your api key:
```
String key = 'your api key';
Critic().initialize(key);
```

Step 2: Create a new Bug Report using the .create const:
```
BugReport report = BugReport.create(
    description: 'description text',
    stepsToReproduce: 'steps to reproduce text',
);
```

Step 3: Use the Critic() singleton to submit your BugReport (example using Futures):
```
Critic().submitReport(report).then(
    (BugReport successfulReport) {
      //success!
    }).catchError((Object error) {
      //failure
    });
```

Step 4: Review bugs submitted for your organization using [Critic's web portal](https://critic.inventiv.io)
